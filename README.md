# unbappd
App for checking in and viewing reviews of local liquor products

## Introduction
	
Unbappd is an application which allows users to see or leave reviews on alcoholic beverages that are sold in their area. The site will allow users to search for a type of alcohol and return a list of reviews for beverages sold in their area. If no reviews have been written, you can become the first by leaving a review of your own.
